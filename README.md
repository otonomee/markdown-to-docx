## Converting Markdown to DOCX

1. To convert the generated Markdown file (or any other Markdown file) to a Word document, use 
the `markdown_to_docx.py` script:
```
python markdown_to_docx.py <input_markdown_file>
```

2. The script will generate a Word document with the same name as your Markdown file, but with a 
`.docx` extension.
